Two data sets were used in the analysis for the CitiBike Data. One was from 2017 January, February, and March. The other was from 2020 August. The phenomenas found in the dataset were that majority of bikers in 2017 were biking in January and our largest age group was from the 1980s. There are a large amount of customers compared to subcribers in our dataset.
